# Master-Thesis

This repository contains the scripts and code used for my master thesis.

The folder "scripts" contains the scripts of the fine-tuning experiments.

The notebook "Augmenting Datasets with Random Noise for Fine-Tuning.ipynb" contains the function to augment the datasets with random noise.

The CSV-file "Results - Original Models.csv" contains the results of the original not-fine-tuned E5 and MPNet models on our tasks.
